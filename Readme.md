## Terraform for Azure Tutorial

This repository demonstrates the capabilities of HashiCorp Terraform for Microsoft Azure. In this Repository, I take a closer look at specific aspects of azurerm provider. This mini-course will be developed as part of my certification preparation. Feel free to reach out to me or simply open an issue!

I highly condensed the individual lectures to display essential parts of my implementation approaches.
